GitHub is an easy-to-use platform that makes managing and sharing code simple for developers of all skill levels. Its user-friendly interface allows you
to create repositories, track changes, and collaborate with others through version control using Git. One of its biggest advantages is how it streamlines teamwork—multiple
people can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work. GitHub also makes it easy to back up code, review changes, and roll back to previous
versions when needed. In addition, features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project boards help teams stay organized and communicate efficiently. Overall, GitHub is a powerful
yet accessible tool that improves productivity, collaboration, and code quality.
